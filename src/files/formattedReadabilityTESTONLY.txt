Oh wise judge he cried I have come to you for justice
I had a beautiful kind gentle horse which has been killed by this mans savage horse
Make the man pay for the horse or send him to prison
Not so fast my friend the judge said
There are two sides to every case
He turned to the poor man
Did your horse kill this mans horse
he asked
The poor man made no reply
The judge asked in surprise Are you dumb
Can you not talk
But no word came from the poor mans lips
Then the judge turned to the rich man
What more can I do
he asked
You see for yourself this poor man cannot speak
Oh but he can cried the rich man
He spoke to me
Indeed
said the judge
When
He spoke to me when I tied my horse to the tree
What did he say
asked the judge
He said Do not fasten your horse to that tree
My horse is savage and may kill yours
ho
said the judge
