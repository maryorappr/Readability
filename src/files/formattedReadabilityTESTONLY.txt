When the young people returned to the ballroom it presented a decidedly changed appearance
Instead of an interior scene it was a winter landscape
The floor was covered with snow-white canvas not laid on smoothly but rumpled over bumps and hillocks like a real snow field
The numerous palms and evergreens that had decorated the room were powdered with flour and strewn with tufts of cotton like snow
Also diamond dust had been lightly sprinkled on them and glittering crystal icicles hung from the branches
At each end of the room on the wall hung a beautiful bear-skin rug
These rugs were for prizes one for the girls and one for the boys
And this was the game
The girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys at the other and one end was called the North Pole and the other the South Pole
Each player was given a small flag which they were to plant on reaching the Pole
This would have been an easy matter but each traveller was obliged to wear snowshoes
